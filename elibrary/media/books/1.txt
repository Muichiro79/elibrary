Solid mindset. That *"I'll carry this whole thing if I have to"* energy will take you far — especially with real-world projects where teammates sometimes ghost or drag feet. If you're leading the charge, here's how we’ll break this project down so you don’t burn out or waste time.

---

## 🧩 Phase 1: Tech Setup (Today)

Let’s get your environment clean:

* ✅ Django installed
* ✅ Virtualenv ready
* ✅ Project + core app created (e.g., `elibrary`)
* ✅ Database connection set (default = SQLite)
* ✅ Git initialized (optional but pro move)

If you want, I can drop you the exact terminal commands and file structure to speed that up.

## 🧱 Phase 2: Core Models (Backend First)

We’ll create models for:

* `User` (extend Django's default)
* `Book`, `Video`, `Category`, `BookType`
* `IssueRecord` (who borrowed what + return tracking)

I'll help you write them with **clear comments**, and we’ll use Django admin to manage it easily at first.

## 🖥️ Phase 3: Templates and Views

Start building:

* Home (public)
* Book list/search
* Login/Register
* Book detail + online reading
* Admin panel

We can use **Django’s class-based views** (CBV) or function-based views (FBV), depending on how comfortable you are. I’ll explain both.

## 🔐 Phase 4: Permissions & Download Control

Lock down what guests, users, and admins can/can’t do:

* Downloads restricted unless admin gives access.
* Online reading available for all registered users.

---

## 📦 Phase 5: Extra Features

* Video section
* Password reset/change
* Reports page (book count per category)
* Dashboard (using simple charts if time permits)

---

## 📝 Phase 6: Docs & Testing

Once code is stable, we’ll smash the documentation — no stress. I'll help write up each part based on your actual implementation.

### Let’s start:

**Do you already have the Django project set up?**
Or should I give you the commands to scaffold everything fast (with virtualenv + settings + starter models)?
